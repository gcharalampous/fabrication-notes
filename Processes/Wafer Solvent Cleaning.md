## Objective
To thoroughly clean wafers to remove contaminants and residues, ensuring they are suitable for subsequent fabrication steps.

## Materials
- Wafer
- Acetone
- Isopropyl alcohol (IPA)
- Deionized water (DI water)
- Piranha solution (H₂SO₄ and H₂O₂)
- Nitrogen gas (N₂) gun

## Equipment
- Chemical fume hood
- Hot plate
- Beakers
- Tweezers
- Safety gloves
- Safety goggles
- Lab coat

## Safety Precautions
- Always work under a chemical fume hood.
- Wear appropriate PPE, including gloves, safety goggles, and a lab coat.
- Handle Piranha solution with extreme care. It is highly corrosive and can cause severe burns.
- Dispose of chemicals according to your facility's hazardous waste disposal guidelines.

## Procedure
1. **Preparation**
    - Place the wafer in a beaker.
    - Preheat the hot plate to 60°C.

2. **Acetone Cleaning**
    - Pour enough acetone into the beaker to fully submerge the wafer.
    - Place the beaker on the preheated hot plate for 5 minutes to dissolve organic residues.
    - Remove the wafer using tweezers and rinse thoroughly with deionized water.

3. **IPA Cleaning**
    - Submerge the wafer in a beaker filled with IPA.
    - Place the beaker on the hot plate for 5 minutes.
    - Remove the wafer using tweezers and rinse thoroughly with deionized water.

4. **Final Rinse and Drying**
    - Perform a final rinse of the wafer with deionized water.
    - Use a nitrogen gas (N₂) gun to blow dry the wafer completely.

5. **Inspection**
    - Inspect the wafer under a microscope to ensure all contaminants have been removed.

## Troubleshooting
- **Residue Remaining**: If residues persist after acetone and IPA cleaning, use the Piranha solution step.
- **Wafer Damage**: Ensure proper handling with tweezers and avoid excessive heat.
- **Chemical Residue**: Ensure thorough rinsing with DI water after each cleaning step.
