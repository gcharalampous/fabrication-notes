## Description
The substrate cleaner is used for the thorough cleaning of substrates, removing contaminants, organic residues, and particles to ensure optimal surface conditions for subsequent fabrication processes.

## Manufacturer
- **Brand:** XX
- **Model:** XXX

## Specifications
- **Cleaning Method:** Ultrasonic cleaning
- **Frequency:** 40 kHz
- **Tank Capacity:** 2.8 liters
- **Temperature Range:** Ambient to 69°C
- **Timer:** 0-99 minutes

## Components
- **Ultrasonic Tank:** Stainless steel tank for holding cleaning solution and substrates.
- **Heater:** Built-in heater to control the temperature of the cleaning solution.
- **Ultrasonic Transducers:** Generate ultrasonic waves for cleaning.
- **Control Panel:** Interface for setting time, temperature, and ultrasonic power.

## Safety Precautions
- Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, safety goggles, and lab coat.
- Ensure the ultrasonic cleaner is placed on a stable surface.
- Do not use flammable solvents in the ultrasonic cleaner.
- Handle cleaning solutions with care, following all safety guidelines and data sheets (MSDS).

## Operation Procedure
1. **System Preparation**
    - Ensure the ultrasonic cleaner is clean and free of any residues from previous use.
    - Fill the tank with the appropriate cleaning solution (e.g., deionized water with a few drops of detergent).

2. **Loading the Substrate**
    - Place the substrates in a holder or directly into the ultrasonic tank, ensuring they are fully submerged in the cleaning solution.
    - Ensure substrates are evenly spaced and not touching each other to allow effective cleaning.

3. **Setting Parameters**
    - Turn on the ultrasonic cleaner.
    - Set the desired temperature (e.g., 40°C) using the control panel.
    - Set the cleaning time (e.g., 10 minutes).

4. **Cleaning Process**
    - Activate the ultrasonic function and monitor the process.
    - Periodically check the substrates to ensure they remain fully submerged and are not damaged.

5. **Rinsing**
    - After the cleaning cycle, carefully remove the substrates using tweezers.
    - Rinse the substrates thoroughly with deionized water to remove any residual cleaning solution.

6. **Drying**
    - Use a nitrogen gas (N2) gun to blow dry the substrates completely.
    - Inspect the substrates under a microscope to ensure they are clean and free of contaminants.

## Troubleshooting
- **Insufficient Cleaning**: Increase the cleaning time or temperature, or change the cleaning solution.
- **Damage to Substrates**: Reduce the ultrasonic power or check for compatibility of substrates with ultrasonic cleaning.
- **Residual Contaminants**: Ensure thorough rinsing and use fresh cleaning solutions.

## Maintenance
- **Daily:** Empty and clean the ultrasonic tank after each use.
- **Weekly:** Check and clean the ultrasonic transducers.
- **Monthly:** Inspect the tank and transducers for any signs of wear or damage.

**Operator:** Jane Doe

**Notes:** Observed slight residue on substrates after cleaning. Increased cleaning time to 15 minutes which resolved the issue.

## Next Steps
- Update the standard procedure to include the extended cleaning time for heavily contaminated substrates.
- Schedule a review of the cleaning solution effectiveness.
