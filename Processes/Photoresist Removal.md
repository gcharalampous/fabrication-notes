## Objective
To safely and effectively remove photoresist from the wafer surface without damaging the underlying layers.

## Materials
- Wafer with photoresist
- Photoresist stripper (e.g., acetone, 1165 PR remover)
- Deionized water (DI water)
- Isopropyl alcohol (IPA)
- Nitrogen gas (N2) gun

## Equipment
- Chemical fume hood
- Hot plate
- Beakers
- Tweezers
- Gloves
- Safety goggles

## Safety Precautions
- Work in a well-ventilated area or under a chemical fume hood.
- Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, safety goggles, and lab coat.
- Dispose of chemicals according to your facility's hazardous waste disposal guidelines.

## Procedure
1. **Preparation**
    - Place the wafer in a beaker.
    - Preheat the hot plate to 85°C

2. **Photoresist Stripping**
    - Pour enough photoresist stripper (e.g., acetone, MR 1165) into the beaker to fully submerge the wafer.
    - Place the beaker on the preheated hot plate for 10-15 minutes. Monitor to avoid overheating.
    - Gently agitate the beaker to enhance the stripping process.

3. **Rinsing**
    - Carefully remove the wafer from the beaker using tweezers.
    - Rinse the wafer thoroughly with deionized water to remove any residual stripper.
    - Perform a final rinse with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) to promote drying.

4. **Drying**
    - Use a nitrogen gas (N2) gun to blow dry the wafer completely.

5. **Inspection**
    - Inspect the wafer under a microscope to ensure all photoresist has been removed. If necessary, repeat the stripping process.

## Troubleshooting
- **Incomplete Removal**: If photoresist remains on the wafer, increase the immersion time in the stripper or slightly increase the hot plate temperature.
- **Damage to Wafer**: Ensure the hot plate temperature does not exceed 85°C to prevent damage to the wafer.
- **Chemical Residue**: Ensure thorough rinsing with DI water and IPA to remove all chemical residues.

**Operator:** Georgios Ch.

**Notes:** Observed slight residue on the wafer after initial stripping. Increased immersion time to 20 minutes which resolved the issue.

## Next Steps
- Review the current procedure for potential optimizations.
