## Objective
To remove organic contaminants and residues from silicon wafers and other substrates using the Piranha cleaning process, ensuring the substrates are clean and suitable for further processing.

## Materials
- Silicon wafers or other substrates
- Deionized (DI) water
- Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂, 30%)
- Sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄, 98%)

## Equipment
- Chemical fume hood
- Teflon or glass beakers
- Hot plate
- Tweezers
- Safety gloves
- Safety goggles
- Lab coat
- Face shield

## Safety Precautions
- Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, safety goggles, lab coat, and face shield.
- Perform all steps under a chemical fume hood to avoid inhaling fumes.
- Handle chemicals with extreme care, following all safety guidelines and data sheets (MSDS).
- Piranha solution is highly reactive and can cause explosions if mixed improperly or in contact with organic materials. Add hydrogen peroxide to sulfuric acid slowly to avoid violent reactions.
- Never store Piranha solution. Prepare it fresh and use it immediately. Dispose of the used solution safely according to your facility's hazardous waste disposal guidelines.

## Procedure
1. **Preparation**
    - Ensure all equipment and materials are ready and the work area is clean.
    - Preheat the hot plate to 120°C.

2. **Mixing Piranha Solution**
    - In a Teflon or glass beaker, carefully mix the following in a 3:1 ratio:
        - 3 parts sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄, 98%)
        - 1 part hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂, 30%)
    - **Important**: Always add the hydrogen peroxide to the sulfuric acid slowly and never the other way around to avoid violent reactions.

3. **Heating the Solution**
    - Place the beaker on the preheated hot plate.
    - The solution will heat up exothermically and may bubble vigorously. Allow it to stabilize before proceeding.

4. **Cleaning Process**
    - Using tweezers, carefully place the silicon wafers or other substrates into the heated Piranha solution.
    - Allow the substrates to soak in the solution for 10-20 minutes, ensuring they are fully submerged.
    - Monitor the solution, and do not leave it unattended during this time.

5. **Rinsing**
    - After the cleaning duration, carefully remove the substrates using tweezers.
    - Rinse the substrates thoroughly with deionized water to remove any residual chemicals.

6. **Drying**
    - Use a nitrogen gas (N₂) gun to blow dry the substrates completely.
    - Inspect the substrates under a microscope to ensure they are clean and free of contaminants.

## Troubleshooting
- **Incomplete Cleaning**: Ensure the solution is fresh and the correct concentration. Increase the soaking time if necessary.
- **Chemical Residue**: Ensure thorough rinsing with DI water after the cleaning process.
- **Wafer Damage**: Handle wafers carefully with tweezers and avoid excessive soaking times.

## Maintenance
- **Daily:** Clean the beakers and hot plate after each use.
- **Weekly:** Inspect the chemical fume hood and ensure it is functioning properly.
- **Monthly:** Check the condition of the safety equipment and replace as needed.
