## Objective
To remove organic contaminants and particles from silicon wafers using the RCA-1 cleaning process, ensuring the wafers are clean and suitable for further processing.

## Materials
- Silicon wafers
- Deionized (DI) water
- Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂, 30%)
- Ammonium hydroxide (NH₄OH, 29%)

## Equipment
- Chemical fume hood
- Teflon or glass beakers
- Hot plate
- Tweezers
- Thermometer
- Safety gloves
- Safety goggles
- Lab coat

## Safety Precautions
- Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, safety goggles, and lab coat.
- Perform all steps under a chemical fume hood to avoid inhaling fumes.
- Handle chemicals with care, following all safety guidelines and data sheets (MSDS).
- Avoid direct contact with chemicals and dispose of waste according to your facility's hazardous waste disposal guidelines.

## Procedure
1. **Preparation**
    - Ensure all equipment and materials are ready and the work area is clean.
    - Preheat the hot plate to 75°C.

2. **Mixing RCA-1 Solution**
    - In a Teflon or glass beaker, mix the following in a 5:1:1 ratio:
        - 5 parts deionized water (DI water)
        - 1 part hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂, 30%)
        - 1 part ammonium hydroxide (NH₄OH, 29%)
    - Carefully add the chemicals in the order listed to avoid violent reactions.

3. **Heating the Solution**
    - Place the beaker on the preheated hot plate.
    - Heat the solution to approximately 75°C, stirring gently to ensure even heating.

4. **Cleaning Process**
    - Using tweezers, carefully place the silicon wafers into the heated RCA-1 solution.
    - Allow the wafers to soak in the solution for 10-15 minutes, ensuring they are fully submerged.
    - The solution will bubble and turn slightly yellow as it cleans the wafers.

5. **Rinsing**
    - After the cleaning duration, carefully remove the wafers using tweezers.
    - Rinse the wafers thoroughly with deionized water to remove any residual chemicals.

6. **Drying**
    - Use a nitrogen gas (N₂) gun to blow dry the wafers completely.
    - Inspect the wafers under a microscope to ensure they are clean and free of contaminants.

## Troubleshooting
- **Incomplete Cleaning**: Ensure the solution is at the correct temperature and concentration. Increase the soaking time if necessary.
- **Chemical Residue**: Ensure thorough rinsing with DI water after the cleaning process.
- **Wafer Damage**: Handle wafers carefully with tweezers and avoid excessive heating.

## Maintenance
- **Daily:** Clean the beakers and hot plate after each use.
- **Weekly:** Inspect the chemical fume hood and ensure it is functioning properly.
- **Monthly:** Check the condition of the safety equipment and replace as needed.
